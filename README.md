🧩 Data Structures & Algorithms — Practice Repository

This repository contains my personally curated solutions to a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.
Each solution is written in C++, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and conceptual understanding.

📚 Topics Covered

✅ Array & Strings – Sliding window, prefix sum, hashing, sorting
✅ Recursion & Backtracking – Subsets, permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku
✅ Linked List & Stack/Queue – Implementation and interview patterns
✅ Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree (BST) – Traversals, LCA, diameter, flattening
✅ Heap / Priority Queue – Kth elements, merging, scheduling
✅ Graph Algorithms – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological sort, Union-Find
✅ Dynamic Programming (DP) – Subset sum, Knapsack, LIS, matrix paths
✅ Greedy Algorithms – Interval scheduling, Huffman, minimum platforms
✅ Binary Search on Answers – Optimization and search problems
✅ Mathematics & Bit Manipulation – Modular arithmetic, set bits, masks
