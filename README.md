# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms — Practice Repository

This repository contains my personally curated solutions to a wide range of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems.  
Each solution is written in **C++**, focusing on **clarity**, **efficiency**, and **conceptual understanding**.

✅ **Arrays & Strings** – Sliding window, prefix sum, hashing, sorting  
✅ **Recursion & Backtracking** – Subsets, permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku  
✅ **Linked List & Stack/Queue** – Implementation and interview patterns  
✅ **Binary Tree & BST** – Traversals, diameter, flattening, lowest common ancestor  
✅ **Heap / Priority Queue** – Kth elements, merging, scheduling  
✅ **Graph Algorithms** – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological Sort, Union-Find  
✅ **Dynamic Programming (DP)** – Subset sum, Knapsack, LIS, matrix paths  
✅ **Greedy Algorithms** – Interval scheduling, Huffman coding, activity selection  
✅ **Binary Search on Answers** – Optimization and range problems  
✅ **Mathematics & Bit Manipulation** – Modular arithmetic, GCD, bitmasking
