# 🤔 Am I the only one who solved this in such a simple way? 😌✨

## 🎯 Problem name  
**Special Triplets** — (count triplets `(i, j, k)` with `i < j < k` that satisfy `nums[i] + nums[j] = nums[k]`)

> The function name `specialTriplets` and the pattern of arrays `memo` / `duplets` strongly suggests this is the intended problem: count the number of ordered index triples where the sum of two earlier numbers equals a later number.

---

## 🎯 Intuition — what you want to do  
> We want to count the number of triples `(i, j, k)` with `i < j < k` such that:
>
> ```
> nums[i] + nums[j] == nums[k]
> ```
>
> A typical way to do this in one left-to-right pass is:
> - Keep `memo[val] =` how many times a value `val` has appeared so far (occurrences among indices < current index).
> - Keep `duplets[s] =` how many ordered pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j < current_index` exist whose sum is `s`.
> - When you arrive at `nums[k]` (current number), add `duplets[nums[k]]` to the answer — those are all pairs `(i, j)` before `k` whose sum equals `nums[k]`.
> - Then update `duplets` by incorporating the new pairs formed by the current number with all previous numbers: for every previously seen value `v` (count `memo[v]`), add `memo[v]` to `duplets[v + nums[k]]`.
> - Finally increase `memo[nums[k]]++`.

This yields the correct count in O(total distinct values seen × n) if implemented with map-based iteration over seen values, or O(n·U) if arrays over full range used with careful bounds.

## 🧠 Why this works  
> - `duplets[s]` stores how many index-pairs `(i, j)` (with `i < j`, both < current index) sum to `s`. So when current value equals `s`, each such pair contributes one valid triple with the current index as `k`.  
> - By iteratively updating `duplets` using `memo` counts, every new number creates new pair-sums with previous numbers that future elements can match against.  
> - This is just counting combinations by value aggregates rather than enumerating all triples explicitly.

---

## ⚠️ Important note about the code you posted
> The code you gave looks like it implements that approach, but it contains an inconsistency that **prevents it from implementing the general pair-sum update**. Specifically:
>
> - The intended update is (for current `number`):  
>   `for all prevValue v: duplets[v + number] += memo[v]`
>
> - The posted code instead does:
>   ```java
>   int twon = number * 2;
>   duplets[twon] += memo[twon];
>   ```
>   That updates only the single index `2 * number` using `memo[2 * number]`. In other words the code only updates a duplet count for sums equal to `2 * number` and uses the count of previous occurrences of `2*number` as the increment. That does **not** reflect the general `v + number` update and therefore **does not** count all triplets `nums[i] + nums[j] = nums[k]`. It only interacts with very specific patterns (roughly related to equalities involving `2*value`), so the result is incorrect for the general problem.

## 🔍 What the posted code actually does (precise behavior)
For each element `number` processed left→right:
1. `res += duplets[number]` — add whatever duplets are currently stored at index `number`.
2. Compute `twon = number * 2`.
3. `duplets[twon] += memo[twon]` — add `memo[twon]` (how many times value `twon` appeared previously) into `duplets[twon]`.
4. `memo[number]++` — record that `number` has now appeared.

Consequences:
- `duplets[x]` is only nonzero if at some earlier time the code explicitly updated `duplets[x]`. But the only updates write to `duplets[twon]` when processing a value equal to `twon/2`. Thus `duplets[val]` may be changed only when a previously processed value `v` had `2*v == val`. The update uses `memo[val]` (count of previous occurrences of `val`) as the increment — which is unrelated to the counts of pairs summing to `val`.
- Net effect: the code *does not* build `duplets` as "count of pairs summing to index". Instead it performs a very different recurrence; results will be wrong for the general `a + b = c` counting problem.

So **as written** the code is buggy for the standard "count triplets a+b=c" problem. It may have been a copy/paste or index-mapping error (likely `duplets[twon] = duplets[twon] + memo[ number ]` or more generally `for all v: duplets[v + number] += memo[v]` was intended).

## 🔧 Correct approach (what you should implement)

### Option A — correct general approach using maps (safe and simple)
Use a `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` for `memo` and another `HashMap<Integer, Long>` for `duplets` and, for each new `num`, iterate the keys of `memo` to update pair sums. This keeps ranges flexible and avoids huge arrays.

### Option B — optimized one-pass (also common)
If value ranges are small (or compressed), you can maintain counts in arrays and update `duplets[v + num] += memo[v]` by iterating only over values `v` that have `memo[v] > 0`.

Below is a corrected, clear Java implementation using HashMaps (works for general arrays and large values, and keeps modulo as in your original):

```java
class Solution {
    public int specialTriplets(int[] nums) {
        // Use a large prime for modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow
        final long MOD = 1_000_000_007L;

        /* * memo: Stores single numbers seen so far.
         * Key: the number value, Value: frequency of that number.
         * Represents potential nums[i].
         */
        Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>(); 

        /* * duplets: Stores counts of pair-sums (nums[i] + nums[j]) formed so far.
         * Key: the sum (nums[i] + nums[j]), Value: total occurrences of that sum.
         * Represents potential sums for nums[k].
         */
        Map<Integer, Long> duplets = new HashMap<>();

        long res = 0L;

        for (int number : nums) {
            /* * STEP 1: Check if the current 'number' can be 'nums[k]'.
             * If 'number' exists in 'duplets', it means there are existing pairs (i, j) 
             * where i < j < current_index and nums[i] + nums[j] == number.
             */
            res = (res + duplets.getOrDefault(number, 0L)) % MOD;

            /* * STEP 2: Treat 'number' as 'nums[j]' and form new pairs with 'nums[i]'.
             * Iterate through all unique values 'v' seen previously (the 'memo').
             * For every occurrence of 'v', we form a new pair-sum (v + number).
             */
            for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> e : memo.entrySet()) {
                int v = e.getKey();          // A value representing nums[i]
                int cnt = e.getValue();       // How many times nums[i] appeared
                
                long sum = (long) v + number; // The resulting pair-sum
                
                // Add these new pairs to our duplets map for future 'k' indices to find
                duplets.put((int)sum, (duplets.getOrDefault((int)sum, 0L) + cnt) % MOD);
            }

            /* * STEP 3: Treat 'number' as a potential 'nums[i]'.
             * Record that we've seen this value to be used by future 'j' indices.
             */
            memo.put(number, memo.getOrDefault(number, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Return result cast back to int as per method signature
        return (int) (res % MOD);
    }
}
